The whole presentation is in the `mvvm.flux` folder.

The TaskLoaderView component is here: https://github.com/roubachof/Sharpnado.TaskLoaderView

Be sure to use the `TemplatedTaskLoader` if you want to use custom views for your UI states.
The `TaskLoaderCommand` and `CompositeTaskLoaderNotifier` are showcased in the "Commands and snackbar" page.

The mvvm.flux sample (*exclusive lights* :) is here: https://github.com/roubachof/Mvvm.Flux.Maui
