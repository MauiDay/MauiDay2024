### Mvvm Flux: a one way update architecture for MAUI  
**Jean-Marie Alfonsi** - [@Piskariov](https://twitter.com/Piskariov)  
***Freelance software engineer at Sharpnado
I am a freelance developer with 15+ years of experience. Lately I'm focusing primarly on Xamarin, sharing some experiences through Sharpnado.com while maintaining the https://github.com/roubachof/Sharpnado.Presentation.Forms library. Before that, I endorsed multiple roles: SOA architect (aka micro services), Windows Forms developer, DBA, Antivirus analyst...***  
Mvvm is nice, but not enough...
We will explorer all the architectural patterns we need to implement to obtain a consistent state throughout our MAUI apps.

The key here is the "flux" pattern, the propagation of updates from commands to the domain, and back to the subscribed view models, that will trigger the UI update.

We'll see how to handle different use cases such as:
* loading data
* updating data
* error when loading
* error when updating
* error when updating

We'll see how the sharpnado's TaskLoaderView (https://github.com/roubachof/Sharpnado.TaskLoaderView) can help to elegantly implementing all those use cases.

Through all the presentation a PoC will be showcased to demonstrate those principles.

### MVU who?  
**Mark Allibone** - [@MAllibone](https://twitter.com/MAllibone)  
***Technical Lead at Rey Technology, Microsoft MVP
Mark Allibone serves as a Technical Lead at Rey Technology and a Microsoft MVP.

In addition to his professional endeavors, he co-hosts the Null Pointers podcast. You can find him on most platforms as mallibone.***

Model View Update (MVU) is a UI architecture pattern that has gained popularity lately. Every C# developer can write MVU-oriented .NET MAUI apps. So let's look at how MVU stacks up to the well-known Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. And, of course, we will want to see how MVU holds up when writing apps for the real word.

### Choose your own adventure  
**Shaun Lawrence**  - [@Bijington](https://twitter.com/Bijington) 
***Senior Software Engineer, Microsoft MVP, speaker and published author. Maintainer of the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit, Xamarin Community Toolkit, Orbit game engine.***  

Growing up I used to love diving into a ‘choose your own adventure’ style book and then later on in life, the same concept in video game form. I would like to apply this concept in today’s talk…

Join me in learning about how we can build video games with .NET MAUI in the form of a ‘choose your own adventure’ style game. You as the collective audience will be able to choose the paths that we go down and influence the content that gets presented.

Learn through our own voting system how we can combine technology such as SignalR to provide real time multi-player support into our .NET MAUI based games as well as many other cool techniques to really make our games or applications feel alive.

### CommunityToolkit.Mvvm is the only mvvm framework you’ll need  
**Konrad Müller** - [@KonMue](https://twitter.com/konmue)  
***Software engineer - Xamarin user since 2016, these days mostly interested in ASP.NET Core, Xamarin.Forms, Blazor and video games!***

In the past, powerful mvvm frameworks were an essential part of nearly all xamarin applications. But these might be a thing of the past, because nowadays, one toolkit can solve most of our mvvm needs.
